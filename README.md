This is the backend for FindMyBeer! All data is from https://www.brewerydb.com/ 
Ruby Version 2.6.1.
SQLite was used for the database. 
Clone this repo and run bundle install. Run rails db:seed. 
Run "rails s" and your backend should be configured as localhost:300 for the front end to work.
Have fun!
